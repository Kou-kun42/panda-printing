          <h2>What is Panda Printing?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The goal of Panda Printing is to extend the tools and resources of 3D
          printing to those who would not have access to it otherwise. 3D
          printing has advanced significantly over the recent years. Users are
          now able to create complex shapes and stuctures that were not possible
          in the past with conventional techninques such as wood and
          metalworking, with the added benefit of being low cost. While 3D
          printing has become more affordable, there is still a large learning
          curve required to be able to use and maintain a 3D printer which can
          produce consistant, high quality prints. At Panda Printing, we
          understand that not everyone has the time or capital to invest in
          buying and caring for a 3D printer, and that's OK! Panda Printing is
          designed to quickly and efficiently put this powerful technology into
          the hands of the end user. Learn more about the specifics of our 3D
          printing solution below!

          <h2>Our Printing Solution</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Currently Panda Printing only has one printer, however we plan to
          expand that in the future. Our main printer is an Ender 3 Pro fitted
          with several modifications that allow for the best quality prints. The
          printer has a maximum print size of 220mm x 220mm x 250mm. This
          printer is equipped with a bowden style extruder using low tolerance
          Capricorn tubing that greatly reduces stringing. It also has an SKR
          Mini E3 control board with onboard TMC2209 stepper motor drivers that
          allow for higher precision and faster print speeds. Manually leveling
          a print bed can be inconsistent and time consuming. This is why our
          solution uses a BLTouch auto leveling sensor which operates before
          every print to create the perfect first layer, everytime. Finally, our
          printer has the latest Hero Me style hotend cooling system that
          enables far steeper supportless printing angles than the stock setup.
